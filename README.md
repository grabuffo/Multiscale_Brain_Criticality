# Multiscale_Brain_Criticality
Code to reproduce the results of “Multiscale Brain Dynamics at the Edge of Criticality” (Rabuffo et al., 2025). Minimal neural mass models embedded in the mouse connectome reveal how local and global criticality interact to shape avalanches, timescale gradients, and scale-free dynamics.
